# Sillyface Games

A collection of browser-based games, deployed with [nobrainer.host](https://github.com/dvassallo/nobrainer.host).

## Games

Each folder is a separate game, automatically deployed to its own subdomain:

- [knockoff-f1](https://knockoff-f1.assetstacks.com) - Racing game
- [cube-run](https://cube-run.assetstacks.com) - Endless runner
- [planes](https://planes.assetstacks.com) - Flight game
- [space-platforms](https://space-platforms.assetstacks.com) - Platform game
- [crafter](https://crafter.assetstacks.com) - Crafting game

## Deployment

This repo uses [nobrainer.host](https://github.com/dvassallo/nobrainer.host) for zero-config deployment. Push to `main` and each game folder becomes a subdomain automatically.
